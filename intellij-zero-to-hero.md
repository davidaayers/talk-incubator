This is a talk about learning IntelliJ, from the basics of leaning on IntelliJ to do simple work for you, all the way through mastering shortcuts and keystrokes to become a master of the IDE.

This repo contains the talk itself. The example project used in this talk is located here: https://github.com/davidaayers/emoji-cowsay

TALK ABSTRACT
-------------


TALK DESCRIPTION
----------------


Script
------

* Introduction
* Projects & Modules (Include this? Not sure how useful this can be)
* Let the code do the work
	Write your code, let Intellij create the classes!
	Example using TDD
		When writing a test, if you do something wrong with an assert, you can use
		cmd-enter to run with a breakpoint in the problematic assert (you'll see the squiggle lines over the assert text)
* Moving around & Editing
	Cmd-W to select
	Move selected text 
* Code Analysis (pay attention to the gutter!)
* Common Refactorings
* Postfix Templates
* Live Templates
* File Templates
* Run Configuration Templates
* Local History

Others, maybe:

Scratch files
Build in tools:
	Terminal
	DB Browser
	Rest call testing
Git support
	Select parts of a file to commit

Research
--------
```
Develop this talk for internal/external use
Build it in modules/sections, so it can be used as a lightning talk (the lightning version should be something like “the five coolest things you didn’t know IntelliJ did”
Cover keyboard shortcuts, auto complete blocks.
Have a section on “let the IDE do the work”, with stuff like just typing code and letting IntelliJ finish it with code extractions, variables, etc.
