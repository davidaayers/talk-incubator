Distributed Tracing With Spring Boot
------------------------------------

Could be a lightning talk with concepts/code snapshots
Could be a 30-45 minute talk with live coding examples
Show an example of tracing using x-request-id/x-correlation-id for http traffic across services
Bonus, show it as a header in a JMS message, and show how that works
Use the cowsay service, implemented as a spring boot app, and build a version of the “fortune” service as a spring boot app to show the distributed tracing between the two of them.
