Get Your Teams Commit-ted!
--------------------------

10 Minute talk, submitted to Lead Developer.

Most of our teams some sort of version control system; if you're doing devops-y stuff, it's likely you are using git. Using these follows a familiar pattern: You do some work, commit the work, and push it to a remote repository, perhaps creating a Pull Request or Merge Request for review.

Here's the thing – what you put into your commit messages matters. Those commit messages are either love letters to your future self, or hate mail. You’ve heard the maxim that code is written once and read many times, and the same goes for commit messages. Putting some thought into what you put into your commit messages (and making them readable) is important.

And commit messages are only 1/2 the story -- these commits work together to for a pull or merge request, usually to be reviewed by another human. The same care and attention should be put into how your structure your PRs. They should tell a story through a series of logic progressive steps that end up implementing the feature or fixing the bug.

So get you team commit-ted to crafting useful commit messages!
