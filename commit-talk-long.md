A talk about writing good commit messages, and why it's important.

*This is a work-in-progress; probably should be in the incubator*

Talk Abstract
-------------

Commit messages should be the story *behind* the code that you're writing, and taken as a whole, 
they should reveal the intentions and decisions that lead to the code that was included. Also, 
when done well, they provide anyone reading your code (including your future self) a roadmap 
that guides them through those decisions and intentions.
