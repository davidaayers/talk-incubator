Please, Repeat Yourself
-----------------------

Why DRY & building code for re-use is almost always a terrible idea.

People trying to be too DRY often end up over-complicating things they *think* will be re-used
Don’t DRY something up until you’ve done it a 3rd time
Don’t confuse “intrinsically” similar code with “accidentally” similar code
